# Web accessibility overlays lists

<i lang="fr">[Version fran√ßaise](readme.md)</i>

There are a lot of web accessibility overlays.

These tools are generally represented by a button named ‚ÄúAccessibility‚Äù or containing an icon of a person in a wheelchair or a Vitruvian man. When clicked, these buttons display a series of options to modify the visual appearance of the website or to read the content of the page with a speech synthesizer, etc.

These tools are individually installed in the websites.

You can find below a non-exhaustive list of these tools.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you want to install one of these tools (or another one):

1. **At first, make you website compliant with WCAG rules at the AA level at least** (or with other accessibility reference from your country but based on WCAG);
1. **Then, test each functionality of the tool you have installed on the different pages of your website** to ensure that everything is functional and that new accessibility issues do not arise.

Indeed, unfortunately, and even if it is sometimes promised, **no tool can make a website fully compliant with WCAG rules or fully accessible to all disabled people**.

## Open-source free tools

- [AccessConfig](https://accessconfig.a11y.fr/)
- [Confort de lecture](http://www.confortdelecture.org/)
- [One Click Accessibility](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pojo-accessibility/) (WordPress plugin)
- [Orange Confort+](https://confort-plus.orange.com/): this tool is different because it is mainly a free browser add-on but it is possible to install it on your own site as well; this is not recommended. Instead, it is recommended to suggest that users install the add-on if they want to change the appearance of the site according to their needs. In this way, they will be able to change the appearance of all the websites they visit.
- [WP Accessibility](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-accessibility/): this WordPress plugin fixes common accessibility problems in themes and has, in addition, a ‚ÄúToolbar‚Äù module which is an accessibility overlay.

# List of browser add-ons to help navigation and browsing of web sites

There are browser add-ons that have the same purpose as the accessibility overlays mentioned above: to adapt the appearance of web pages to some needs of some disabled people. However, the add-ons are supposed to work on all websites.

Of course, they will generally work better on websites that already comply with the WCAG standard. The existence of these add-ons must not be a reason for not making your website accessible because they do not make websites accessible or compliant with WCAG rules.

- [EasyReading](https://www.easyreading.eu/): add-on available on Firefox and Chrome
- [Lexia Reader](https://www.oziku.tech/) by Oziku Tech¬†: add-on available on Firefox, Chrome and Edge
- [Omoguru](https://www.omoguru.com/)¬†: add-on available on Chrome, dedicated to dyslexic people
- [Orange Confort+](https://confort-plus.orange.com/): add-on available on Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer
